# Wizlight Bulb Audio Sync Project

Ryan McClean's QUB final year project.

This project is an attempt to synchronize the brightness and color of Wiz light  
bulbs with the rhythm of music, either played from the local device, or the  
ambient music, using the microphone of the device.  

The project has been developed in Python (There was an attempt in Java, but it did not work).  

## Features

- **Audio Synchronization**: Dynamically adjusts the brightness of Wiz light bulbs based on the rhythm and beats of the music.  
- **Local and Ambient Music Support**: Works with both locally played music and ambient sound captured via the device's microphone.  

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pyaudio` for audio input
  - `numpy` for signal processing
- **Hardware**: Wiz light bulbs and a computer (Windows, or Linux) with a microphone.
