Java FFT library:
    TarsosDSP
    tagtraum.jipes

Python FFT library:
    Realtime_PyAudio_FFT
        - I've forked this, I'm going to edit it, so it isn't a visualiser, but rather a library I can use for the FFT algo

Python PyAudio Library Fork:
    PyAudioWPatch


Beat Detection Algo:
    https://www.parallelcube.com/2018/03/30/beat-detection-algorithm/


Running in linux:
    Must be running PulseAudio
    Have to create a loopback device for main output
    Have to switch fallback to this speaker device
    (If this could be done via the cli this would be great)
    Might not be the best situation for someone who's running this on their home machine

    Cannot run PyAudioWPatch, has to use og PyAudio
    TODO have to build in a way of only loading PyAudioWPatch if it's available
