toggle bulb test failing on local machine and on CI passing into the wrong view?

CI caught bug that only shows when db table doesn't exist. So would have
prevented installs. I had put a call to the table in the init of the app, before
the table is created. Which is fine when the machine has it already, but would
error on a fresh install
